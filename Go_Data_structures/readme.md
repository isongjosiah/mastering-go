A graph (G(V,E)) is a finite, nonempty set of vertices (V)(or nodes) and a set of edges (E).
There are two main type of Graphs: cyclic graphs and acyclic graphs. cyclic graphs have all or a number of it's vertices connected in a closed chain, 
in acyclic there are no closed chains.
A directed graph is a graph with edges that have a direction associated with them.
a directed acyclic graph is a directed graph with no cycles in it.
As a node may contain any kind of information, nodes are usually implemented using Go structures due to their versatility.
