A binary tree is a data structure where underneath each node there exist at most two other nodes. This means that a  node can be connected to one, two, or no other node.
The root of a tree is the first node of the tree.
The depth of a tree, also callled the height of a tree is the longest path from the root to a node
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the root of the tree. 
A leaf is a node with no children
A tree is considered balanced when the longest length from the root node to a leaf is at most one more than the shortes such length.
Balancing a tree might be a difficult and slow operation, so it is better to keep your tree balanced from the begining rather than trying to balance it after you have created it.
