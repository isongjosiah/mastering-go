A hast table is a data structure that stores one or more key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots,from whichthe correct value can be discovered.
Ideally, the hash function should assign each key to a unique bucket provided that you have the required number of buckets which is usually the case.
